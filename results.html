    <h4>Discussion/Results</h4>
        <p>
            From the above dimensions, we selected six dimensions – accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness, validity, since they appear across multiple frameworks, they are distinct from each other, and were deemed relevant for the open data to be evaluated. Also, since we will be considering open data some of the data dimensions would not be applicable such as Latency, Compliance, etc.. Although these selected dimensions are similar to the Data Management Association’s (DAMA) framework dimensions, they present a difference in how their metrics are measured or scored. Additionally, most of the existing research and implementations on data quality frameworks focus solely on closed data while our implementation focuses on open data quality assessment.
            Data Quality Metrics and Scoring
            Considering that there are multiple types of data formats, each might require a different approach for reading and processing. For easy processing of data, we will be working with tabulated data; these are Comma Separated Values (CSV) and Excel file formats.
            For each selected dimension we chose evaluation metrics that were used as scoring attributes to assess the associated data quality dimension. Below are the data quality dimensions with their corresponding metrics:
