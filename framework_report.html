        <h2>Data Quality Assessment Framework</h2>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p> 
            Data quality is a crucial aspect in every business and government application as it determines the reliability of our systems and paves the way for systems’ performance improvements. Data is the cornerstone of informed decision making, strategic planning, and operational efficiency. However, ensuring data quality presents significant challenges in today’s world. Among the challenges that impede the quality of data are data entry errors, incomplete data, outdated data and lack of data standards. And while it seems easier to establish standards for data quality internally in an organization, it is rather harder to do the same for open data due its ‘open’ nature, which presents a challenge in determining its integrity.
            This report presents the methodology and findings of the project aimed at developing a Data Quality Assessment Framework for open data. The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive framework that assesses open data quality across multiple dimensions – accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness, validity, along with an assessment tool for scoring datasets.
